Our Project aims to offer the opportunity for users such as workers, developers, students etcâ€¦ to find jobs easily, share their problems and help them get answers to their toughest questions of any domains, inspirations and skills. Also, it guarantees the communication between users by sharing their thoughts and opinions. Therefore The user is able to benefit from the series of courses in several fields to obtain certifications, he is able to make a group of works on this space which allows him to organize the work(to do, doing done) When the user goes to apply for a job after sending his resume. Automatically, if the cv does not suit all that was requested in this job it will be refused .
Furthermore, there is a part of the worker which will allow the user to apply for his CV for a project which will be selected and then graded. Afterwards he will have an interview with the company to get another note.
The sum of these two notes will make the difference between all the participants to choose the project manager who will himself share the tasks between all the members of the team with a well determined deadline.
In the user's profile, he has a private part, which will not be visible to other users of this space, where he will be able to keep all these important documents (courses, projects...) this part will allow him to avoid the risk of losing them and at the same time to find all these documents in the same place.
